# ü•ã UFC Fighters Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

## üìå Project Overview 
This project explores the UFC Fighters Statistics dataset from Kaggle. 
The goal is to analyze various fighter attributes, identify trends, and extract meaningful insights using data visualization techniques.

## üìÇ Dataset
- Source: [UFC Fighters Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/ufc-fighters-statistics)
- Contents: The dataset includes information such as fighter height, weight, reach, stance, wins, losses, draws, and other performance-related statistics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

## Overview 

### ‚úÖ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing ‚Äì checking for missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
1. Missing Data Count Plot
   Displays the total number of missing (NaN) values for each column.

2. Missing Data Percentage Plot
   Shows the percentage of missing values for each column.

### ‚úÖ Correlation Analysis & Visualization ‚Äì Using heatmaps to find patterns in the data.

### ‚úÖ Fighter Performance Metrics ‚Äì Investigating relationships between wins, losses and other statistics.
1. Plot made to examine the relationship between wins and losses among UFC fighters. However, to focus on a more realistic range of data, it filters out extreme outliers before plotting:
```python
df_body = df[df['wins'].between(0,100) & df['losses'].between(0,40)]
```
 Why Limit the Dataset?
 - Only 2 fighters have more than 100 wins, and only 4 fighters have more than 40 losses.
 - Including these extreme values would skew the visualization and make it harder to see trends among the majority of fighters.
 - By focusing on 0-100 wins and 0-40 losses, the plot better represents typical UFC fighters, making patterns more visible.

 ### ‚úÖ Fighting Styles & Stances ‚Äì Examining how different fighting stances impact success in the UFC.

Left Plot: Average Win Ratio for Each Stance
- Displays the average win ratio across different stances.
- Helps identify which stances are generally more successful.

Right Plot: Zoomed-in Win Ratio (0.7 to 0.8)
- Focuses on the win ratio range between 0.7 and 0.8 for better comparison.
- Highlights subtle differences that might be missed in the full-range plot.

Key Insights: 

‚úÖ Switch Stance is the Most Effective ‚Äì Fighters using a Switch stance tend to have the highest average win ratio. This could indicate that adaptability in stance provides a competitive advantage.

‚ùå Open Stance is the Least Effective ‚Äì Fighters using an Open stance generally have the lowest win ratio, suggesting it might not be as strategically effective in UFC fights.

### ‚úÖ Fighter Attributes Distribution ‚Äì Analyzing the distribution of height, weight, and reach among UFC fighters.

Scatter plot used to visualize the relationship between height (in cm) and reach (in cm) while incorporating weight (in kg) as a distinguishing color factor.

### ‚úÖ Analysis of Striking, Wrestling, and Their Impact on Win Rate
Added 'win rate' 'striking' and 'wrestling' to datafream
```python
df["win-ratio"] = df["wins"]/(df["wins"] + df["losses"])
df["striking"] =np.where(df['significant_strike_defence'] != 0,
                         df['significant_striking_accuracy']/df['significant_strike_defence'],
                         0)
df["wrestling"] =np.where(df['takedown_defense'] != 0,
                         df['takedown_accuracy']/df['takedown_defense'],
                         0)
```
A red KDE plot visualizes the density distribution of striking efficiency and win ratio.

### ‚úÖ Analysis of the Line Plot: Takedown Defense vs. Takedown Accuracy

This visualization examines the relationship between takedown defense (x-axis) and takedown accuracy (y-axis) using a line plot. The dark red line represents the trend in how well fighters defend against takedowns versus their ability to land successful takedowns.

### ‚úÖ Analysis of the Line Plot: Takedown Defense vs. Submission Attempt Frequency

This visualization explores how a fighter‚Äôs takedown defense (%) (x-axis) correlates with their average number of submission attempts per 15 minutes (y-axis). The dataset excludes fighters with zero takedown defense and zero submission attempts, ensuring a more meaningful analysis.

### ‚úÖ Other findings 
- fighter with most registered wins: Travis Fulton	253 wins
- fighter with most registered losses: Shannon Ritch 83 losses 
- the haviest fighter: Emmanuel Yarborough 349.27 kg
